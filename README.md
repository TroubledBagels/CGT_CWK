## The discussed approaches are:
Stochastic Gradient Descent with traditional ML techniques
Multi-Layer Perceptron with bootstrapping of training data
Regression Comparison by optimising several polynomial reaction functions and choosing the best model by some metric i.e. R2


## 12/3/2025 
This week, we aim to:
Get our working environment running and set up branches for development.
Investigate the literature surrounding solving Stackelberg games of imperfect information.
Get familiar with the provided codebase and get some basic code running.

## Timeline:
w/c 17/03: Rough implementations + lit review
w/c 24/03: Experimentation + lit review + overfitting considerations
w/c 31/03: Flesh out each agent
w/c 07/04: Decision week - choose which agent implementation to drill down on
w/c 14/04: Optmisations + documentation
w/c 21/04: Presentation prep + optimisation
w/c 28/04: Final checks (code done)
